###Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model
##📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Logistic Regression machine learning model using Python. The model is trained to perform binary classification using supervised learning techniques.

The project was developed using VS Code and common Python data science libraries.

##🧠 What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict categorical outcomes, most commonly binary outcomes such as:

Yes / No

0 / 1

True / False

It works by estimating probabilities using a sigmoid function.

##🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

Python 3

VS Code

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn

##✅ Results

The Logistic Regression model successfully predicts the target variable with reasonable accuracy. Performance can be improved with:

Feature scaling

Hyperparameter tuning

Trying other classification models

##🚀 Future Improvements

Add cross-validation

Implement additional models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)

Create a GUI or web interface

Save and load the trained model
